# Facial-Recognition-using-Keras-
Convoluational neural network model which performs facial recognition. 

This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network that is capable of recognizing people faces.
The model is only trained for recognizing two personnalities for the time being, the authors of this.

The notebook is pretty structured and well commented in order to clarify steps as well as some code snippets.
