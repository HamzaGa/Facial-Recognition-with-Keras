# Facial-Recognition-using-Keras- 

This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network that is capable of recognizing people by their faces.

The purpose behind this project is pure experimentation. Therefore, the model is only trained for recognizing two personnalities for the time being, the authors of this. Hopefully this will be improved in the future to be capable of doing more. 

The Juyter notebook is pretty structured and well commented in order to clarify steps as well as some code snippets. 

Feel free to give feedback!
